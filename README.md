# Waste-classification
This project uses CNN, ResNet50, and YOLOv8 models with a Raspberry Pi camera to classify waste into categories like paper, plastic, glass, and others. IoT sensors monitor container capacity and send alerts when full. A website is also built for testing and showcasing the system.
