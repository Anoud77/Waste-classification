# Waste-classification
The Waste Classification System is designed to help the environment by simplifying the recycling process. This system classifies waste into four categories: Glass, Paper, Plastic, and Waste. It has been trained using three different deep learning models to identify the best performing one, with ResNet50 chosen for its superior speed and accuracy. The system is then integrated with Raspberry Pi 4 to enable real-time waste classification, making it an ideal solution for IoT-based recycling applications.
